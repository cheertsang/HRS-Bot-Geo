## Abstracts
Over the past several semesters, AguaClara has been facing problems with the stability of the floc blanket within the sedimentation tank. Although floc blankets would rapidly form within the sedimentation tank, the particle removal by floc blanket decreased with time as indicated by the increase in effluent turbidity, known as floc blanket decay. During the Summer of 2018, the High Rate Sedimentation Team noticed that flocs in the sedimentation tank were actually accumulating at the bottom, and believed this accumulation was the cause of floc blanket decay.

Hence, the purpose of the High Rate Sedimentation Bottom Geometry is to determine a method for eliminating or reducing the floc blanket decay currently occurring in sedimentation tanks in the lab by addressing the accumulation of flocs at the bottom of the tank. The team hopes to accomplish this by developing a new shape and geometry of the bottom of the sedimentation tube in order to maximize the reuse of large settling flocs.

## Introduction

The High Rate Sedimentation Bottom Geometry Team was created to improve sedimentation, which is a crucial part of the water treatment process as it acts as the major removal method for suspended and coagulated minerals, dirt, and particles. The main challenge for the Bottom Geometry Team is finding an optimal bottom geometry of the tube settler to prevent sediment buildup at the bottom. Although the sediment buildup does not affect sedimentation efficiency, this buildup should be avoided to make the cleaning of the apparatus easier. The bottom geometry influences the density of the floc blanket, a dense layer of suspended flocs to which small or uncoagulated particles can attach and subsequently be removed.

<!-- It would be helpful if you included a diagram of the sedimentation tube, as people with no knowledge of AguaClara wouldn't know what you are talking about here. For example, showing an image of the sed tube with a floc blanket to show what a floc blanket is. Also include some background on how the sedimentation tube relates to the plants in Honduras; make the distinction between the lab sed tubes and the sed tanks used in the actual plants -->

However, in the AguaClara lab, the floc blanket would initially form but decay with time, so the performance of the system drastically decreased. After discussions regarding the differences between the design of the sedimentation tanks in the plants and in the lab, the High Rate Sedimentation: Bottom Geometry team was created to determine the optimal shape of the bottom of the sedimentation tubes in the lab to ensure the consistent formation of a stable floc blankets.

<!-- Explain what you mean by "floc blanket decay" and "stable floc blankets" - define what these terms mean -->

## Literature Review and Previous Work
A previous High Rate Sedimentation Team proposed changes to the bottom geometry of the tube settler in the summer of 2018. The tube settler initially had a flat bottom, but buildup was observed and grew about half an inch in height every ten minutes. A cone was drilled in the bottom of the water inflow tube, but floc buildup at the bottom was still observed. A possible explanation for the floc buildup was that flocs locked together in a ring that was larger than the drilled hole, which could not be broken up by the upflow of water, therefore preventing the resuspension of those flocs.

**Table 1: Summary of HRS Summer 2018 experiment results.**
|Experiment|Upflow Velocity (mm/s)|Coagulant Dosage (mg/L)|Floc Blanket Formed|Ending Effluent Turbidity|Insights|
|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:---|:------|:---|
|[11](#experiment-11)|3|3.0|Yes|16 NTU|Faster floc blanket formation|
|[12](#experiment-12)|3|4.5|Yes|2-3 NTU &rarr; 11-12 NTU|Even faster floc blanket formation|
|[13](#experiment-13)|4|4.5|Yes|27-28 NTU|Gelling observed in flocculator and sedimentation tank|
|[14](#experiment-14)|4|4.5 <br/> with higher pump speed|Yes|~30 NTU|Gelling still observed; 4 mm/s may be too high|
|[15](#experiment-15)|3|4.5|Yes|27 NTU (at 1 hr)| With inserted, flat surfaced sedimentation tank bottom to observe floc buildup|
|[16](#experiment-16)|3|4.5|Yes|22 NTU|With conical sedimentation tank bottom, flocs are still building up|

The HRS Summer 2018 experiments confirm that a flat and conical bottom cause floc buildup. They also confirm that an upflow velocity of 3 mm/s and a coagulant dosage of 4.5 mg/L are optimal parameters for high rate sedimentation. These parameters are used in the current High Rate Sedimentation Bottom Geometry Team methods.

A previous Fluoride team proposed another change in the bottom geometry in which the bottom of the tube was cut at an angle and the bottom was closed except for a small part at the longest part of the tube for the inflow. The tube was essentially "squished" at the bottom such that the cross sectional areas are more rectangular than circular. This prevents flocs from locking together in a ring and causing buildup at the bottom. The stream of water broke up the buildup and allowed flocs to recirculate in the tube settler.

## Methods
The main focus of the High Rate Sedimentation Bottom Geometry team was floc blanket stability through the modification of shape of the bottom of the tube settler. Hence, the independent variable of the experiments conducted by the team was the shape of the bottom and the dependent variable was the floc blanket performance and stability. Critical controlled variables were the flow rate, coagulant dose, and influent turbidity.

The flow rate through the system was calculated in accordance to the desired upflow velocity of 3 mm/s, as determined by the work conducted by the High Rate Sedimentation Team in the summer of 2018. The tube settler had an inner diameter of 1 inch, so the formula dV/dt=pi*r^2*dh/dt was used to determine that a flow rate of 90 mL/min was appropriate for the experiment.

<!-- Format the equation using proper Markdown equation syntax -->

A coagulant dose of 4.2 mg/L was chosen by the High Rate Sedimentation Bottom Geometry Team to ensure coagulant was not a limiting factor in the system. Finally, the influent turbidity chosen was 100 NTU which is the standardized influent turbidity for the AguaClara High Rate Sedimentation teams.

The data utilized to compare and analyze the performance of the filter insert was the effluent turbidity as it provided comparable values to determine the floc blanket performance and stability. The minimum effluent NTU would directly correlate with the performance, with lower values indicating better performance. Additionally, the floc blanket stability would be determined by the time it takes for the effluent turbidity to start increasing after reaching the maximum removal, as the longer the time it takes for the turbidity to increase, the more stable the blanket would be.

### Experimental Apparatus

  ![HRS Bottom Geometry Apparatus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/master/Images/ExperimentalApparatus.PNG)
**Figure 3: High Rate Sedimentation Fall 2018 apparatus.**

As shown in the figure above, the overall experimental setup consists of a flocculator, clay and coagulant reservoirs, a tube settler, and four distinct pumps. The first pump controls the water flow throughout the system with the flow rate set manually. The second pump is controlled by ProCoDA with the use of PID Control to dose clay into the system to create 100 NTU influent water.

<!-- "create 100 NTU influent water" -> maintain the influent turbidity at 100 NTU -->

The third pump is used to control the coagulant dose and is also set manually. The final pump is used to pump effluent out of the floc weir to prevent the buildup of too many flocs.

<!-- maybe would be helpful to label pumps 1-4 on your diagram -->

### Procedure
The procedure of setting up the HRS Bottom Geometry experimental apparatus is detailed below.

1. Use Python coagulant dosing calculations to determine the required coagulant pump speed for the desired coagulant dosage.

<!-- Include a hyperlink so that future teams know where to find the Python calculation document -->

2. Check all valves and connections to make sure desired pathways are clear and undesired pathways are blocked.
3. Verify all influent, effluent, and coagulant pumps are set to desired experimental flow rates.
4. Turn on influent pump to fill sedimentation tank with clean water.
5. Turn on clay stock stirrer if not already on.
6. Turn on influent and coagulant pumps.
7. Set state to PID control in ProCoDA (this will turn on clay pump).

Throughout the experiments, the primary data collected and analyzed was the effluent turbidity. This was measured automatically by ProCoDA and logged into an Excel file for analysis once the experiment concludes.

### Designing Inserts
Design 1 - Symmetrical AguaClara Plant Design

As the issue of the unstable floc blanket is limited to the lab and not the actual AguaClara plant, the first design was inspired by the design of the AguaClara plant.

![Design of AguaClara Plant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/master/Images/AC%20plant%20filter.PNG)   
**Figure 4: Design of sedimentation tanks in AguaClara plants.**

As seen in Figure 4, the AguaClara sedimentation tanks utilize two sloped surfaces to guide settling particles into the central high flow area. The off-centered input of water results in a difference in end results of the settling flocs. The flocs that slide down the slope on the right would join the high inflow stream directed downward, which are subsequently directed back up through the semicircle at the bottom and become resuspsended in the floc blanket. However, the flocs sliding down left side would collide with the flocs in the upward stream to form larger flocs to be resuspended in the blanket.

<!-- Maybe label your diagram above to make this section more clear. For example, add arrows to show direction of water flow and the direction flocs are sliding -->

Inspired by this design, the HRS Bottom Geometry Team along with the Fluoride Auto Team designed the "Symmetrical AguaClara Plant Design."

<!-- Include a link to the OnShape model that Fluoride Auto designed -->

![Symmetrical AguaClara Plant Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/master/Images/fluoride%20auto%20insert.PNG)
**Figure 5: Filter insert with symmetrical, rectangular cross sections and a sloped top portion.**

As seen in Figure 5 above, this design closely resembled the sedimentation tank design in the AguaClara plant, except for the location of the input. This decision was made primarily due to the design of the tube settler, as an off-centered insert would not align with the centered inflow tube at the bottom of the tube settler. Although the bottom of the design was a square due to complications in using CAD software, this would then easily be modified after 3D printing by drilling.

Design 2 - Off-centered Cone

Although the conical shape was tested by the HRS Summer 2018 team, the centered design still caused a buildup of flocs. The off-center conical shape most closely resembles the sliced tube filter designed by a previous Fluoride team. If the water inflow comes from the side of the tube, it can break up the rings of flocs that would have otherwise collected near the bottom. This exactly conical design would not be practical to insert into the tube settler, so a new design was created to make testing easier. The new design is shaped like a regular cylinder, but the hollow part of the cylinder is shaped like an off-center cone, and there is an open hole for the water inlet.

![Symmetrical AguaClara Plant Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/master/Images/off%20center%20cone%20in%20cylinder%20CAD.PNG)  
**Figure 6: Off-center conical insert with circular cross sections and water inlet at the tip.**

<!-- Specify which design you ultimately decided to go with, and explain that decision. It looks like you decided to go with design 1, but maybe add a couple sentences here at the end of the methods section to clarify that decision. Also, I'm wondering if the "squished" triangular design from the Fluoride team above worked well, was that factored into your new bottom geo design at all? Maybe mention that in this section, and explain why you didn't go with that design, or if that influenced your design 2 in any way. -->

## Results and Analysis
The first experiment run by the Bottom Geometry team was the baseline control experiment at 3 mm/s upflow velocity.

![Failed Control Experiment](https://github.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/blob/master/Images/Baseline%20Attempt.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 7: Graph of failed control experiment with high effluent turbidity.**

As seen in the graph, the turbidity of the effluent lies between 30 NTU and 60 NTU for the first 5.25 hours. In the beginning before the first hour, a floc blanket formed and stabilized. However, the blanket began to decay fairly quickly, which is indicated by the rapid increase of effluent turbidity. Upon closer analysis, it was found that the improper calibration of the pumps caused the floc blanket to fail due to excessively high flow rate through the system. Hence, another trial was set with the recalibrated pump.

![Successful Experiment of 3mm](https://github.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/blob/master/Images/3mm%20original%20flocc%20updated.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 8: Effluent turbidity over time for a 3 mm/s upflow velocity experiment.**

In this experiment, a stable floc blanket formed with a consistent effluent turbidity of below 5 NTU. Although the floc blanket appeared unstable, the experiment had a long run time of 14 hours and the effluent turbidity stayed below 10 NTU.

<!-- How did you determine whether a floc blanket was "stable" or not? -->

Additionally, decay was linear as opposed to exponential decays observed in previous semesters. Compared to the results of the previous HRS teams' experiments, the blanket formed was more stable and efficient. The summer 2018 team was able to produce a blanket at 3 mm/s upflow velocity, but they were not able to produce one at 2 mm/s upflow velocity. Hence, a trial was set to compare the performance at 2mm/s upflow velocity between the Bottom Geometry system and the HRS Summer 2018 results.

Below are the results from the experiment run with an upflow velocity of 2 mm/s.
![2mm Successful Experiment](https://github.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/blob/master/Images/2mm%20original%20flocc%20updated.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 9: Effluent turbidity over time for a 2 mm/s upflow velocity experiment.**

In this experiment, a floc blanket formed with consistent removal with an effluent turbidity of 2-4 NTU. Additionally, there was no floc blanket decay as the effluent NTU remained constant throughout the trial. The increase in turbidity at the end of the figure was contributed to the depletion of clay stock, not the decay of the blanket itself. This result strongly contradicts that obtained by the HRS Summer 2018 team, as the current Bottom Geometry team was able to form a blanket at 2 mm/s. Additionally, results also contradicted observations by the previous few HRS teams, as the floc blanket did not decay. After comparing the lab setup between the apparatus with that of the Summer and previous semester teams, the Bottom Geometry team believed the difference would be attributed to the difference in flocculators, as other components appeared identical. Hence, a trial was set up to compare whether the flocculator would impact the floc blanket formation.

![Flocculator Comparison](https://github.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/blob/master/Images/2mm%20flocc%20comparison%20updated.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 10: Comparison of flocculator performance.**

In this figure, the effluent turbidity from the 2 mm/s upflow velocity trial was plotted with the effluent turbidity at 2 mm/s upflow velocity, but using the flocculator utilized by the HRS Summer 2018 team and the current HRS Floc Recycle team. The blue data indicates the results from Figure 9, and the red data represents the results from the HRS Summer 2018 and Floc Recycle flocculator. From this data, the Bottom Geometry Team could not conclude that the variance in filter performance was caused by differences in the flocculator.

![Floc buildup](https://github.com/AguaClara/HRS-Bot-Geo/blob/master/Images/Floc%20buildup.PNG?raw=true)
**Figure 11: Buildup of flocs in tube settler.**

From the figure above, the Bottom Geometry Team was able to deduce that the stability of the floc blanket was due to the stationary buildup of flocs at the bottom of the sedimentation tank. This acted similarly to a floc blanket with channels that allowed for smaller-sized flocs to pass through the large channels and get removed. Additionally, a dense floc blanket with actual suspended particles was positioned above the floc buildup, thus improving the filter efficiency.

## Conclusions
During the semester, the Bottom Geometry team has noticed significant differences between their results and that of previous AguaClara teams. Unlike previous semesters, the team was creating floc blankets which were more efficient and more stable. At an upflow velocity of 2mm/s the system had a low effluent turbidity of 2-3 NTU throughout the trial and thus had no floc blanket decay. At an upflow velocity of 3mm/s, the system maintained a low effluent turbidity of under 10 NTU throughout the trial, with a linear increase in effluent opposed to rapid exponential floc decay observed in previous semesters.

The Bottom Geometry team determined that the stability of the floc blanket obtained throughout the system was due to a buildup of flocs in the sedimentation tank. The floc buildup created a dense, solid layer of flocs, which did not decay like suspended floc blankets as in previous semester. Thus, the team concluded floc buildup is a beneficial method for eliminated floc blanket decay. However, it cannot be carried forward into AguaClara plants as floc buildup would increase the required maintenance time and down time for the system as settled particles could only be removed manually.

<!-- From what I understand from reading this, the buildup of flocs at the bottom of the sed tube was actually helpful in preventing floc blanket decay. However, this the buildup of flocs cannot be implemented in actual AguaClara plants due to the difficulty in cleaning out the sed tanks. -->

## Future Work
The Bottom Geometry team noticed the floc blanket buildup occurred at an upflow velocity of 2mm/s, which was the upflow velocity which obtained data that showed no floc blanket decay. However, at an upflow velocity of 3mm/s, the floc blanket still decayed, but at a rate slower than previous semesters.

Hence, the next steps would be to observe whether the buildup occurs at 3mm/s. If no floc blanket is formed, the next step would be to determine the difference between the Bottom Geometry apparatus and previous semester's apparatus to determine the cause of difference in floc blanket stability. Additionally, a future step would be to redo the data collection of the floc blanket performance and stability at various coagulant doses, as well as determine whether the buildup occurs at difference doses. Another next step would be to determine whether bottom geometries proposed at the beginning of the semester would result in similar performance but without the floc blanket buildup. Finally, the last step would be to determine whether it is possible that this buildup could be occurring in actual AguaClara plants, below the suspended floc blanket as it is difficult to understand what is occurring underneath the suspended layer.

## Experimental Methods

The following is a general outline of tasks to be done prior, during, and after experimentation. ProCoDA is a software that is used extensively during experiments; the software allows the user to automate data collection and various components of the experimental apparatus. PID stands for proportional integral derivative and is calibrated to control the clay pump via ProCoDA.

 1. Drain the sedimentation tank and flocculator from previous experimental trial, if necessary.
 2. Refill clay and coagulant stock tanks.
 3. Run tap water through the system to rinse the flocculator, sedimentation tank, and connecting piping.
 4. Rinse and refill turbidimeters.
 5. Use Python coagulant dosing calculation to determine the required coagulant pump speed for the desired coagulant dosage.
 6. Check all valves and connections to make sure desired pathways are clear and undesired pathways are blocked.
 7. Verify all influent, effluent and coagulant pumps are set to desired experimental flow rates.
 8. Turn on influent pump to fill sedimentation tank with clean water.
 9. Plug in clay stock stirrer if not already plugged in.
 10. Turn on influent, effluent, and coagulant pumps.
 11. Set state to PID control in ProCoDA (this will turn on clay pump and also turn on data collection).
 12. After the experiment has run for the desired runtime, Set ProCoDa state to OFF, and turn of the water pump and coagulant pump.

### States
The sole state utilized was the PID control state, which controled the clay pump rpm The values of P, i, D were calibrated using this guide https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Calibrating+PID+Control. The Turb Target is set at 100 NTU for all experiments as it is convention for this series of experiments.

The water pump is also controlled by ProCoDA. Whereas, the pump after the sedimentation tank is controlled manually and is set at 60 rpm to maintain a 2 mm/s upflow velocity through the sedimentation tank.

## Python Code
Calculations were done in Python to determine PaCl coagulant dosing parameters and flocculator design parameters in order to run experiments and construct experimental apparatus.
